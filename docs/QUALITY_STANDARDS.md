# Professional Quality Standards

Our ecosystem integrates industry-standard static analysis tools to ensure code quality, security, and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Integrated Tools

| Tool | Focus | Standard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Checkstyle** | Code Formatting | [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) |
| **PMD** | Code Smells & Best Practices | Custom Rulesets (ErrorProne, Best Practices) |
| **SpotBugs** | Logic Errors & Security | Highest Effort, Low Threshold scanning |

## 📈 Running Analysis

To run a full quality audit and generate reports, use the following command from the root:

```bash
mvn clean verify site -DskipTests
```

### Where are the reports?
After the command completes, the reports are centralized in each module's target folder, but the easiest way to view them is via the Maven Site:

1. **Root Summary**: `target/site/index.html`
2. **Checkstyle Report**: `target/site/checkstyle.html`
3. **PMD Report**: `target/site/pmd.html`
4. **SpotBugs Report**: `target/site/spotbugs.html`

*Note: Each sub-module (common-lib, tax-engine-service, etc.) also generates its own local `target/site` reports.*

## 🛡️ Enforcement Logic

These tools are bound to the Maven `verify` phase. This means:
* **CI/CD Safety**: If a developer pushes code that violates style or has a potential null pointer bug, the build will **FAIL** Automatically.
* **Java 21 Ready**: We use the latest versions of these tools (Checkstyle 10.14+, PMD 7+) to support modern features like Records and Record Patterns.

---

## 🚫 Handling False Positives

Sometimes tools may incorrectly flag high-quality code (especially newer Java features). We maintain a centralized exclusion list to keep our source code clean of suppression annotations.

### SpotBugs Exclusions
Location: `spotbugs-exclude.xml` (Root)
Current exclusions include:
* **DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE**: False positives generated by Java 21 Record Patterns / Pattern Matching for Switch.

### PMD & Checkstyle
If repeated false positives occur for PMD or Checkstyle, we will migrate to a custom `pmd-ruleset.xml` or `checkstyle-config.xml` respectively.
